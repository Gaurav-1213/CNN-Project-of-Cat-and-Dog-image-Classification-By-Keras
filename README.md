# CNN-Project-of-Cat-and-Dog-image-Classification-By-Keras
The Dogs vs. Cats dataset is a standard computer vision dataset that involves classifying photos as either containing a dog or cat.  Although the problem sounds simple, it was only effectively addressed in the last few years using deep learning convolutional neural networks. While the dataset is effectively solved, it can be used as the basis for learning and practicing how to develop, evaluate, and use convolutional deep learning neural networks for image classification from scratch.    You will learn the essentials of the image classification systems and the underlying computer vision concepts. After the end of this post, you will be able to create a program that learns how to detect cats, dogs and ultimately anything that is tangible.
